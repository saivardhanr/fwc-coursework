# AVR-GCC with Arduino Droid

**AVR-GCC** is a tool used to write and compile programs for AVR microcontrollers. It converts code written in C or C++ into machine language that the microcontroller can understand. This project shows how to use AVR-GCC with **Arduino Droid** to upload `.ino` files to an Arduino board using an OTG cable.

## **What is AVR-GCC?**

AVR-GCC is a compiler that helps in programming AVR microcontrollers. It is open-source and part of the GNU Compiler Collection. It lets you write programs in C or C++ and compiles them into code that can run on microcontrollers.

## **Features**

- **Open Source and Free** – Available for everyone to use and modify.
- **Cross-Platform** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Supports C and C++** – You can write code in standard programming languages.
- **Optimizations and Compiler Flags** – Helps make your code more efficient.

## **How It Works**

1. Write your code in a `.ino` file.
2. Open **Arduino Droid** on your Android phone.
3. Connect your Arduino board using an **OTG cable**.
4. Upload the file directly to the Arduino.
5. The app uses AVR-GCC to compile and upload the code.
